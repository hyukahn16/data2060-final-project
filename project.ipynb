    "## **Overview of Multiclass Classification: one-vs-all and all-pairs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Give an overview of the algorithm and describe its advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <ins>One-vs-All\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm creates a classifier for each class (3 classifiers if there exists 3 classes). For each classifier, it is responsible for predicting whether an input belongs to its corresponding class or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each classifier is trained on the entire dataset with modifications corresponding to each classifier.\\\n",
    "The modification changes the dataset such that when you're training a classifier for class $3$, labels for all the other classes are modified to $-1$ and labels for the classifier's class are modified to $1$. (More details will be provided in the Representation section)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <ins>All-Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm creates a classifier for each pair of classes. For each classifier, it is responsible for predicting whether a given input belongs to one class or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each classifier is trained a portion of the dataset with modifications corresponding to each classifier.\\\n",
    "First, each classifier is assigned portion of the dataset that contains the classes the classifier is predicting for. Then, the assigned data's classes are changed so that one class is assigned the label of $1$ and the other is assigned the label of $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <ins>Advantages and Disadvantages of Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiclass classification algorithm is an algorithm that classifies an input that can belong to one of the multiple classes (more than two classes).\\\n",
    "For this project, we will be implementing One-vs-All and All-Pairs algorithms for the multiclass classification of the UCI Iris dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to a multiclass classification algorithm that inherently encompasses multiclass classification (output of model predicts multiclass),\n",
    "the main advantages of One-vs-All and All-Pairs stems from the use of binary classifiers.\\\n",
    "Because of the binary classifiers to represent multiclass classification, these two algorithms have implementation simplicity and easy interpretability of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the disadvantages also stem from the use of binary classifiers.\n",
    "- The binary classifiers do not have any knowledge that it is used for multiclass classification and therefore, does not have inherent understanding of the multiclass classification problem.\n",
    "- Due to training classifier for each class, each classifier is trained on a class imbalanced dataset and may result in overfitting.\n",
    "- Training multiple classifiers can be computationally expensive.\n",
