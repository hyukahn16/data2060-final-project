# Overview 
This repository contains the final project for Overfitting Avengers. The project implements One-vs-All and All-Pairs algorithms using Binary Logistic Regression as the binary classifier to address multiclass classification problems on the Iris dataset.

In addition, we conduct unit tests to evaluate and compare the performance of our models with scikit-learn's built-in classifiers, including:
- OneVsRestClassifier
- OneVsOneClassfier
- SGDClassifier

The dataset can be loaded in the ./data directory or can be directly imported using sklearn.
